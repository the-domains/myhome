What is a frontage of a land?

Every lot in a land release has a frontage. It is basically the width of the land. Depending on the council requirement you can fit a house with a certain width on the lot. For example if the land is 12.5m and the council requires you to leave .9 on both sides then your house width will be 12.5-.9-.9 = 10.7m. Hence while selecting the lot, look at the frontage as most double garage designs will fit on minimum of 12.5m lot width(frontage).
